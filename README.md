# VoiceVibes
Voice Vibes was made by me with the help of my trainer. I used Jupyter Notebook to create the code. Voice Vibes has 3 parts to it. The first is emotion recognition, recognizing the sentence given as either “Positive”, “Neutral”, or “Negative”. The second is a sub-section for both Speech to Text conversion and a Text to Speech part as well.
